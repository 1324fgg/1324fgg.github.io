Leveraging Large Language Models for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction

supervised by [Yangqiu SONG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/)

- Developed a method to automatically extract information from text and construct a knowledge graph using large language models (LLMs). The method involves three steps: extracting triples from text, disambiguating and merging nodes into the graph, and performing pattern induction.
- Utilized pre-trained Transformer models for entity recognition and relationship extraction, context-based entity disambiguation algorithms, and clustering and rule induction methods for pattern induction.
- **Tech Stack**: Neo4j, Pandas, NumPy, spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers

**GAN-Generative Adversarial Network**

supervised by [Nevin L. ZHANG](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~lzhang/)

- Reproduced and optimized DCGAN and LSGAN models to generate high-quality images.
- Implemented unpaired image translation using CycleGAN, converting photos to painting styles.
- Participated in model training and tuning, improving the quality and consistency of generated images.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Image, Scikit-Learn, Pillow, Numpy

# Projects of Application

---

- **Research on the Reading Intention of Pirated Online Literature Based on the TPB Model**
    - Validated hypotheses using the SmartPLS software to examine the factors influencing the reading intention of pirated online literature based on **the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).**
    - Constructed a model of factors influencing users' reading intention of pirated online literature, with TPB as the foundation.
    - Analysed data collected through online questionnaires to identify the factors that influence users' reading intention of online literature and examined the interrelationships among these factors.
- **Research on the Pattern of Grassroots Governance in Wuhan City**
    - Employed deep learning techniques and natural language processing methods to analyse **37,394 posts** related to the "Donghu Community - Greater Wuhan" project.
    - Conducted keyword word **cloud analysis** and **sentiment analysis** on the topics of the posts, with the analysis aimed at gaining insights into the themes discussed in the posts and understanding the sentiment tendencies expressed by the participants.
    
- **The 1990-2019 China Outdoor Air Pollution Research Report**
    - Analyzed data with python from the Global Burden of Disease and extracted relevant information on outdoor air pollution in China from 1990 to 2019.
    - Enabled a more intuitive understanding of the changing trends and influencing factors of outdoor air pollution in China, contributing to increased public environmental awareness and serving as a basis for environmental protection policy formulation and air quality improvement.
- **The 14th “HuaZhong” Cup Mathematical Modelling Contest**
    - Collaborated with team members to perform correlation analysis. Applied neural networks to **predict the trading volume and closing price** of the "digital economy" sector index at five-minute intervals.
- **Research on New Trends in the Fruit Industry in  Live stream E-commerce**
    - Utilized the **k-means method** to cluster the comment data and extract key features of the comments.
    - Conducted question mining to **analyse new trends** in the live stream e-commerce field, including debates on off-season fruits, fan economy, and fruit insurance technology.
- **Social Survey Paper on China's Postgraduate Entrance Examination**
    - Constructed a **five-dimensional measurement scale** to assess the anxiety levels of undergraduate students regarding the postgraduate entrance examination, based on the "Biopsychosocial Model" theory.
    - Investigated **the influence of variables** such as gender, major, age, study methods, and whether the student was a cross-disciplinary applicant on postgraduate entrance examination anxiety.
